This is a fork of [`gatsby-starter-blog`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) that uses [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/) for CSS-in-JS instead of the official starter's inline styles.

Everything else is pretty much the same.

## Get started

```
gatsby new gatsby-styled-blog https://github.com/robinmetral/gatsby-starter-styled-blog
cd gatsby-styled-blog
npm i -S
gatsby develop
```
